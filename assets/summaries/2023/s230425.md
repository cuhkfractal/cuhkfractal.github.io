Mastrand Theorem tells us the dimension of a Borel set will not drop under the projection in almost every direction. Furstenberg (1969) conjectured for the product of a $ \times 2 $-invariant set and a $ \times 3 $-invariant set, the dimension will not drop under the projection of all directions except the axis directions. We discussed Hochman and Shmerkinâ€™s proof of this conjecture. The main tools are CP chain and local entropy averages.
