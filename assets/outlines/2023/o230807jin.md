We will talk about the degeneracy of critical Mandelbrot cascades acting on ergodic measures of a
symbolic space, that is the case when the entropy of the random weight equals the entropy of the ergodic
measure. For the degeneracy we need to prove a Chung-Fuchs type theorem that, under mild assumptions,
the summation of a random walk and a Brinkhoff sum, when their means are equal to zero, always has $ + \infty $ as limsup. The proof relies on Dekkingâ€™s generalised recurrence theorem (1982) and the filling
scheme introduced by Chacon and Ornstein (1960).
