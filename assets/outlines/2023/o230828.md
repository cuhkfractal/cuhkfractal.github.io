In this talk, we consider the action of a finitely generated group on the circle by analytic diffeomorphisms. We will discuss some results concerning the dimensions of objects arising from this action. More precisely, we will present connections among the dimension of minimal subsets, that of stationary measures, entropy of random walks, Lyapunov exponents and critical exponents. These can be viewed as generalizations of well-known results in the situation of $ PSL(2,R) $ acting on the circle. This talk is based on a joint work with Yuxiang Jiao and Disheng Xu.
