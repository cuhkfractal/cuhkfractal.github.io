Exercise 4.2 Hausdorff and Minkowski dimensions of  McMullen Set $ K(D) $ agree if and only if $ D $ has uniform horizontal fibers. 
         
Exercise 4.3 Show that if $ D $ has uniform horizontal fibers, then $ K(D) $ has positive finite Hausdorff measure in its dimension. 
         
Exercise 4.5 Compute the dimension of a self-affine set of finite type if we assume the number of rectangles in corresponding rows is the same for each pattern.
