# Student Anaysis Group
ðŸ‘‹ We are a group of research graduate students at \href{CUHK Math Dept}{https://www.math.cuhk.edu.hk/}. Professor \href{De-Jun Feng}{https://www.math.cuhk.edu.hk/~djfeng/} is our supervisor.

Our interests include:
- Fractal Geometry and Dimension Theory
- Geometric Measure Theory
- Dynamical Systems and Ergodic Theory
- Thermodynamic Formalism
- Multifractal Analysis
- Group Actions

To share opinions and discuss about the above topics, we initialize this series of seminars.
