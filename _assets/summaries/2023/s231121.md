We have explored the powerfulness of lifting Lipschitz codings to morphisms between trees, which is a language to express the authors' genuine observation on the continuity of the average of entropies. As a first simple application, we follow Section 6 to present the lower semicontinuity of dimensions of Bernoulli convolutions. Then we move to Sections 7 and 8. After modeling the local dynamics using CP-chains (Markov chains), again we lift the orthogonal projections to tree morphisms, and prove the lower semicontinuity of the dimensions of ergodic CP-chains. This finishes one of the two major parts in the paper.
