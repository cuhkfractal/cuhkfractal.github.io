In computing the box dimension one applies compositions of affine maps to a square containing the attractor and one uses the number of boxes in this covering to get estimates on the minimum number of boxes needed to cover the attractor at various levels. One of the main problems is to know where the attractor is in order to count only those boxes that are needed.

One method is to project the attractor onto a convenient axis and relate the dimension of the projected attractor to the dimension of the original set.
