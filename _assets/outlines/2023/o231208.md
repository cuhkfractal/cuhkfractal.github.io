It is a classical problem to study the evolution of roots of polynomials under application of a differential operator. In this talk, I will discuss the heat evolution of random polynomials with a rotationally invariant root distribution on the complex plane. The limiting root distribution of the heat-evolved random polynomial can be completely determined in terms of its log potential. For example, when a Weyl polynomial, whose root distribution converges to the uniform distribution on the unit disk, undergoes heat flow, the limiting root distribution is uniform on some ellipse until time 1 at which it becomes exactly the semicircle law. This is joint work with Brian Hall, Jonas Jalowy, and Zakhar Kabluchko.
