In this talk, we discuss the pointwise equidistribution properties of measures $ \mu_p $ defined by
digit restrictions on the $ b $-adic expansion, where $ b \geq 2 $ is an integer. We prove that, if a sequence $ (\alpha_n)_{n\geq 1} $ satisfies a certain b-adic diversity condition, then the sequence $ (\alpha_n x)_{n\geq 1} $ is uniformly distributed modulo one for $ \mu_p $-a.e. $ x $. We also find some sufficient conditions to ensure the $ b $-adic diversity. Moreover, we apply these results to establish the $ b $-adic diversity for the sequences that can be written as a certain combination of polynomial and exponential functions.
