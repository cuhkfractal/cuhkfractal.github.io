For an unstable foliation of a diffeomorphism, we use a natural
dynamical averaging to construct transverse measures, which we call
maximal, describing the statistics of how the iterates of a given leaf
intersect the cross-sections to the foliation. For a suitable class of
diffeomorphisms, we prove that this averaging converges, even exponentially
fast, and the limit measures have finite ergodic decompositions.

This is a joint work with R. Ures, M. Viana, F. Yang.
